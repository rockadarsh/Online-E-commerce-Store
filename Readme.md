ONLINE E-COMMERCE STORE
INTRODUCTION:
The main idea of this project is to order products based on the information provided. This project will focus on developing a system for an online store that specializes in selling cameras. The system will be designed to streamline the process of managing inventory, processing orders, and handling customer information.
The project will utilize data structures and algorithms to manage the store's inventory and process orders efficiently. The system will also include features of a user-friendly interface for customers.
In addition to the features mentioned previously, this project will incorporate various data structures to enhance the system's efficiency and performance.
Overall, this project will demonstrate the practical application of various data structures and algorithms in the design and development of an online shopping store management system that sells cameras, by providing efficient and optimized solutions for data storage, retrieval and pathfinding
Implemented Data Structures
• Linked List:

Linked lists are a data structure that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

Reason

The program uses linked lists to manage customer information and orders. The data of user (Delivery, Take Away) is saved in the linked List. We used Linked List instead of array because of dynamic size.

• AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree:

The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that is well-suited for storing large amounts of data and allows for fast insertion, deletion, and searching operations.

Reason

The AVL, for example, will be used to efficiently manage and maintain the store's inventory. All the operations of take away user is handled using AVL tree. The operations like searching, deletion, insertion is done in a better way. The insertion and deletion is done by order ID that is given by the user.

• Graphs:

Graphs has been used in the project to show the areas where the parcel can be delivered. Graphs are represented through adjacency matrix.
